# Othello
<img src=".\othello.gif">
<p>Description:</p> 
<p>Othello (A slight variant of Reversi), is a strategical board game played by two players on an 8x8 uncheckered board. The main objective is for a player to have a majority of their pieces occupying the board. A player is able to take control over the other player's area of the board if they are able to enclose the other player's pieces within a line, example being "XOOOO" placing an X in the last spot -> "XOOOX -> "XXXXX".The game ends when neither player is able to make any more moves, and a winner is decided based on which player controls the most area.</p>
