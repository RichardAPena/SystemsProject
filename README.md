<img src=".\othello.gif">
<p>Description: Othello (Also known as a slight variant of Reversi)
, is a strategical game played by two players on an 8x8 uncheckered board. The main objective is for
a player to have a majority of their pieces occupying the board. A player is able to take control over
the other players area of the board if their are able to enclose the other players pieces within a line
, example being "XOOOO" placing an X in the last spot -> "XOOOX -> "XXXXX". A winner is decided 
when one player controls the most area, or the other player cannot make anymore more moves.</p>
